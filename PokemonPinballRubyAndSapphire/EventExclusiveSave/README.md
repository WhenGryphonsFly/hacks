# Event-Exclusive Starter Save

This save file is a completely fresh save file, except that all four event-exclusive Pokémon are marked as seen in the Pokédex. This will allow them to begin appearing once you have caught Latias and/or Latios.

This save file is compatible with both vanilla and speedchoice.
